# Task 2
## Log File Analyzer

This repository contains a Python script to analyze web server logs. The script performs the following tasks:

1. Counts the number of 404 errors in the log file.
2. Identifies the most requested pages.
3. Lists the most frequent IP addresses making requests.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Required Python packages: `re`, `collections`

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepository.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**

   Change to the directory where the script is located:

   ```sh
   cd YourRepository
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**

   Ensure you have the required Python packages installed. The script uses built-in Python libraries, so no additional installation is needed.

### Usage

1. **Prepare the Log File**

   Create a file named `access.log` in the same directory as the script. Ensure it contains sample log entries, for example:

   ```plaintext
   127.0.0.1 - - [22/Jul/2024:00:00:00 +0000] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 200 1024
   127.0.0.1 - - [22/Jul/2024:00:00:01 +0000] "GET /about.html HTTP/1.1" 200 2048
   127.0.0.1 - - [22/Jul/2024:00:00:02 +0000] "GET /contact.html HTTP/1.1" 404 512
   192.168.0.1 - - [22/Jul/2024:00:00:03 +0000] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 200 1024
   ```

2. **Run the Script**

   Execute the script using Python:

   ```sh
   python backup_solution.py
   ```

3. **View Output**

   The script will print the following information to the console:

   - Number of 404 Errors
   - Most Requested Pages
   - Most Frequent IP Addresses

### Example Output

```plaintext
Number of 404 Errors: 2
Most Requested Pages:
/index.html: 3
/about.html: 2
/contact.html: 1
Most Frequent IPs:
127.0.0.1: 4
192.168.0.1: 2
```

### Troubleshooting

- **FileNotFoundError:** Ensure that `access.log` exists in the same directory as the script and is named correctly.
- **Deprecation Warnings:** If you encounter deprecation warnings, consider updating your libraries or suppressing the warnings temporarily.
